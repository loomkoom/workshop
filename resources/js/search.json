You'll also see an Application ID and Interactions Endpoint URL, which we'll use a bit later in the guide."]},{"l":"Configuring your bot","p":["bot tab","Next we'll configure the bot user for your app, which allows it to appear and behave similarly to other server members.","On the left hand sidebar click Bot.","On this page, you can configure settings like its privileged intents or whether it can be installed by other users.","Intents determine which events Discord will send your app when you're creating a Gateway API connection. For example, if you want your app to do something when users add a reaction to a message, you can pass the GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS( 1 10) intent.","Some intents are privileged, meaning they allow your app to access data that may be considered sensitive (like the contents of messages). Privileged intents appear and can be toggled on the Bot page in your app's settings. Standard, non-privileged intents don't require any additional permissions or configurations.","More information about intents and a full list of available intents, along with their associated events, is in the Gateway documentation.","There's also a Token section on the Bot page, which allows you to copy and reset your bot's token.","Bot tokens are used to authorize API requests and carry your bot user's permissions, making them . Make sure to never share your token or check it into any kind of version control.","Go ahead and copy the token, and store the token somewhere safe (like in a password manager).","You won't be able to view your token again unless you regenerate it, so make sure to keep it somewhere safe."]},{"l":"Adding scopes and bot permissions","p":["Apps need approval from installing users to perform actions in Discord (like creating a slash command or fetching a list of server members). Let's select a few scopes and permissions to request before installing the app.","When creating an app, scopes and permissions determine what your app can do and access in Discord servers.","OAuth2 Scopes determine what data access and actions your app can take, granted on behalf of an installing or authenticating user.","Permissions are the granular permissions for your bot user, the same as other users in Discord have. They can be approved by the installing user or later updated within server settings or with permission overwrites.","Click on OAuth2 in the left sidebar, then select URL generator.","The URL generator creates an installation link based on the scopes and permissions you select for your app. You can use the link to install the app onto your own server, or share it with others so they can install it.","applications.commands which allows your app to create commands.","bot adds your bot user. After you select bot, you can also select different permissions for your bot. For now, just check Send Messages. See a list of all OAuth2 scopes, or read more on permissions in the documentation."]},{"l":"Installing your app","p":["Once you add scopes, you should see a URL that you can copy to install your app.","After installing your app, you can head over to your server and see that it has joined âœ¨","With your app configured and installed, you can start developing it."]}],[{"l":"Dev environment","p":["Clone the following github repo: github.com/loomkoom/bot-template","Below is an overview of the main folders and files:","Install the required libraries, including Discord.py, by running the following command in the command prompt:","python3 -m pip install requirements.txt","Optional: use the Dockerfile to run your bot.
