# API
==- What are Discord's APIs?
Discord has two APIs that you can mix-and-match to build apps:

- HTTP API is a REST-like API for general operations like sending and updating data in Discord, or fetching data about a resource.
- Gateway API is a WebSocket-based API that is helpful for maintaining state or listening to events happening in a Discord server. We won't be using it in this guide, but more information about how to create a Gateway connection and the different events you can listen to are in the Gateway documentation.
